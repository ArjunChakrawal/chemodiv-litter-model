## Overview

This repository contains all code and supporting data for the manuscript investigating the relationship between chemical diversity and litter decomposition dynamics via a mechanistic modeling framework. The primary goal is to simulate and analyze how molecular composition influences decomposition patterns across experimental treatments.

## Setup Instructions

Follow the steps below to set up the repository and generate the figures used in the manuscript.

### 1. Download and extract the repository

- Go to the GitHub page for this repository.
- Click **Code** > **Download ZIP**.
- Extract the ZIP file to a directory of your choice (e.g., `C:\Users\YourName\Documents\litter_decay`).

### 2. Open a terminal

- On **Windows**, open **Anaconda Prompt**, **Command Prompt**, or **PowerShell**.
- On **macOS/Linux**, open your system terminal.

Navigate to the extracted project directory:
```sh
cd path/to/litter_decay
```

### 3. Environment Setup
We recommend creating a clean Python environment using [Mambaforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#mambaforge) or Miniconda. Create an environment named litter_decay from requirements.txt:
```sh
mamba create -n litter_decay --file requirements.txt -y
```
### 4. Activate the environment

```sh
mamba activate litter_decay
```
### 5.  Launch JupyterLab

```sh
jupyter lab
```
JupyterLab will open in your default browser. You can now run the notebooks and generate the manuscript figures.
